## Note
Please be informed that this project is currently in its nascent stage and not yet completed. I am in the process of implementing additional functionality over time. As of now, it serves as a showcase to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency in Angular, TypeScript, and the process of honing my general programming skills.

I am fervently working on enhancing this interactive digital art canvas with more features and optimizations to provide a better user experience.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
